        >"Events from previous summers have impacted <mark>Conrad</mark> and <mark>Jeremiah Fisher's</mark> connection with <mark>Belly </mark>as Belly navigates the difficulties of growing up and her first love. Belly discovers the
        importance of taking chances to achieve her goals and that change is inevitable. Every summer of Belly Conklin's childhood, her family has stayed at the Cousins Beach home of the family of her mother's best friend. Belly suffered as
        a child by feeling left out or like she did not belong because she was the youngest and the only girl among the four children. Belly, however, senses that this summer will be different from previous ones. Belly observes that both
        sons, Conrad and Jeremiah, notice how much she has changed in the last year when she and her family arrive at the Fishers' home. Belly gets the impression that this summer will be one she will never forget because of their interest
        in her".</i
